Subject: [PATCH] XFAIL missing-abstract-variable.ll test on ppc64le

It's seems the strategy with this test is to XFAIL it on all
architectures that it fails on.  I wonder if we should be passing
it a specific triple?  Also, from what I can tell, this tests only
runs when llvm is configured with LLVM_DEFAULT_TARGET_TRIPLE set
to a non-empty value, which is why it may not fail in every build
configuration.
