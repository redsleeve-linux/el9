Subject: [PATCH] oss-fuzz: include generated corpora in the final zip file

Since the files with generated directives are now automatically
generated during build, they're now under the respective build directory
which the current oss-fuzz CI script didn't account for.

Follow-up to: #24958
Fixes: #25859

(cherry picked from commit bef8d18b3f9776fdb28fc9a4820f9ce9418422f9)

Related: #2175619
