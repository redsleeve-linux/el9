Subject: [PATCH] efi: drop executable-stack bit from .elf file
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

An rpminspect test in Fedora/RHEL is flagging our stub files as having an
executable stack. The check is correct:

$ readelf --wide --program-headers build/src/boot/efi/linuxx64.elf.stub | rg -i stack
  GNU_STACK      0x000000 0x0000000000000000 0x0000000000000000 0x000000 0x000000 RWE 0x10

It seems to be just an omission in the linker scriptâ€¦ None of the objects that
are linked into the stub are marked as requiring an executable stack:

$ readelf --wide --sections build/src/boot/efi/*.c.o \
  /usr/lib/gnuefi/x64/libgnuefi.a \
  /usr/lib/gnuefi/x64/libefi.a \
  /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-redhat-linux/12/libgcc.a \
  | rg '.note.GNU-stack.*X'
(nothing)

On aarch64 we end up with a nonexecutable stack, but on ia32 and x64 we get one,
so this might be just a matter of defaults in the linker. It doesn't matter
greatly, but let's mark the stack as non-executable to avoid the warning.

Note: '-Wl,-z' is not needed, things work with just '-z'.

RHEL-only
for now, as the patch is not yet in upstream
