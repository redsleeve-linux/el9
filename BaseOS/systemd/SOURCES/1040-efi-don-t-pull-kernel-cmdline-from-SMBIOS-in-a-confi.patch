Subject: [PATCH] efi: don't pull kernel cmdline from SMBIOS in a confidential
 VM
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

In a confidential VM, the SMBIOS data is not trusted, as it is under the
control of the host OS/admin and not covered by attestation of the machine.

Fixes: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/27604
Signed-off-by: Daniel P. Berrang√© <berrange@redhat.com>
(cherry picked from commit 4b1153cfcc397df5a095f2ec7e587787e8ba47ee)
