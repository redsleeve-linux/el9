-* Add a new service type very similar to Type=notify, that goes one step

-  message that comes with a newer timestamp, then wait for a READY=1 message.
-  while we are at it, also maybe extend the logic to require handling of some
-  specific SIGRT signal for setting debug log level, that carries the level via
-  the sigqueue() data parameter. With that we extended with minimal logic the
-  service runtime logic quite substantially.
