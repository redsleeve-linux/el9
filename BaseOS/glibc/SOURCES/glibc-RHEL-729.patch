Only backport po/it.po and po/ja.po changes for the ESTALE message
translation which we use during CI testing.

commit 7ff33eca6860648fb909df954da4996ce853d01d
Author: Carlos O'Donell <carlos@redhat.com>
Date:   Fri Jul 7 11:27:08 2023 -0400

    Translations: Add new ro support and update others.
    
    This brings in the new Romanian language translations, and updates
    nine other translations. Important translations in this update
    include the Italian and Japanese translations for ESTALE which
    remove the mention of "NFS" from the error message translation.
