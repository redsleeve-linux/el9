    malloc: add multi-threaded tests for aligned_alloc/calloc/malloc
    
    Improve aligned_alloc/calloc/malloc test coverage by adding
    multi-threaded tests with random memory allocations and with/without
    cross-thread memory deallocations.
    
    Perform a number of memory allocation calls with random sizes limited
    to 0xffff.
    
    Use the existing DSO ('malloc/tst-aligned_alloc-lib.c') to randomize
    allocator selection.
    
    The multi-threaded allocation/deallocation is staged as described below:
    
    - Stage 1: Half of the threads will be allocating memory and the
      other half will be waiting for them to finish the allocation.
    - Stage 2: Half of the threads will be allocating memory and the
      other half will be deallocating memory.
    - Stage 3: Half of the threads will be deallocating memory and the
      second half waiting on them to finish.
    
    Add 'malloc/tst-aligned-alloc-random-thread.c' where each thread will
    deallocate only the memory that was previously allocated by itself.
    
    Add 'malloc/tst-aligned-alloc-random-thread-cross.c' where each thread
    will deallocate memory that was previously allocated by another thread.
    
    The intention is to be able to utilize existing malloc testing to ensure
    that similar allocation APIs are also exposed to the same rigors.
