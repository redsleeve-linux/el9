Subject: manual: add syscalls

The purpose of this patch is to add some system calls that (1) aren't
otherwise documented, and (2) are merely redirected to the kernel, so
can refer to their documentation; and define a standard way of doing
so in the future.  A more detailed explaination of how system calls
are wrapped is added along with reference to the Linux Man-Pages
project.

Default version of man-pages is in configure.ac but can be overridden
by --with-man-pages=X.Y

 @cindex kernel call
-System calls are sometimes called kernel calls.
+System calls are sometimes called syscalls or kernel calls, and this
+interface is mostly a purely mechanical translation from the kernel's
+ABI to the C ABI. For the set of syscalls where we do not guarantee
+POSIX Thread cancellation the wrappers only organize the incoming
+arguments from the C calling convention to the calling convention of
+the target kernel. For the set of syscalls where we provided POSIX
+Thread cancellation the wrappers set some internal state in the
+library to support cancellation, but this does not impact the
+behaviour of the syscall provided by the kernel.
+
+In some cases, if @theglibc{} detects that a system call has been
+superseded by a more capable one, the wrapper may map the old call to
+the new one.  For example, @code{dup2} is implemented via @code{dup3}
+by passing an additional empty flags argument, and @code{open} calls
+@code{openat} passing the additional @code{AT_FDCWD}.  Sometimes even
+more is done, such as converting between 32-bit and 64-bit time
+values.  In general, though, such processing is only to make the
+system call better match the C ABI, rather than change its
+functionality.
 
 However, there are times when you want to make a system call explicitly,
 and for that, @theglibc{} provides the @code{syscall} function.
